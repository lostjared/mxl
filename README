for MXL documentation visit: http://lostsidedead.biz/libmxl

This source code is open source, and is licensed under the GNU GPL.
Only restrction is if you use it , you sould share you code to.
MXL is like a toned down XML for  programs that need a small lib
and dynamic interactive data files.
since my program dosent
need anything fancy I thought i would just code code something to
meet the needs of the  application in question. It basicly breaks
a source file  down into a series of data types that can be used
with the program. Syntax is simple and is perfect for my app.
Its all a learning experience for me. 

At first glance code seems to work, more testing should be done.

Compile Instructions:

First insure you have the automake and friends utils installed
and in your path.

then cd to the directory of the extracted files, or the downloaded files from a svn checkout 
first we must compile masc since mxl relies on it.

if your using a unix like OS, or cygwin.

$ cd libmasc
$ chmod +x autogen.sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install


$ chmod +x autogen.sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

$ sudo ldconfig -v


if your cross compiling with mingw  on Linux you will have to change the code for the configuration of 
MXL a little bit. you would have to do the same for libmasc if you were using mingw for Linux as well.

$ chmod +x autogen.sh
$ ./autogen.sh


$ CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/i586-mingw32/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/i586-mingw32/lib" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/i586-mingw32 --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
--target=i586-mingw32msvc

$ make
$ sudo make install


Note: updated the code, now also produces shared librarys instead of just a static lib

after you have completed the above steps
you can try compiling the test examples.
located in the test directory
